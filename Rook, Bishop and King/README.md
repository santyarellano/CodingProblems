# Rook, Bishop and King
## Description
Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8 × 8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (r, c) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:

* A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically.
* A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally.
* A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
