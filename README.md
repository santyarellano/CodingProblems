# CodingProblems (from codeforces) by SSAM
### Objective:
To store my solutions to coding problems.

### Notes:
All folders have both the solution file and the description README.md file

All files have 2 modes: testing and user.
- testing: uses tdd function to run tests automatically
- user: works with user input

> To switch modes toggle testMode variable (True/False)
